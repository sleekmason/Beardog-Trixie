    Welcome to Beardog Trixie. This build has all
    the packages necessary to get a good start at
    designing your system the way you want.
    
    Please visit the forum for more information:

    The live environment passwords are 'user' for 
    username, and 'live' for root.
    
    To install Beardog, reboot the iso and choose 
    'Start installer'.

    After installation, use the welcome script to
    see other initial setup options. You can also
    type 'welcome' in a terminal to use later.
