It should be fairly easy to set your native language for keyboard use. 

You can add the country code entries directly to the configuration file
in this folder to click on a country name from the system tray icon,
or follow the directions below for a more global use with setxkbmap.

Here, we are using the example for the Greek language, with the country 
code letters: "gr".

For your own use, replace the "gr" with the country code desired when
following the instructions below.

Setting up:
For a temporary solution for each session, use the below in a terminal.

setxkbmap -layout "us,gr" -option "grp:alt_shift_toggle"

To set permanently, add a line to ~/.config/openbox/autostart. 
Here are a few common examples:

Greek:
setxkbmap -layout "us,gr" -option "grp:alt_shift_toggle" &

Spanish:
setxkbmap -layout "us,es" -option "grp:alt_shift_toggle" &

German:
setxkbmap -layout "us,de" -option "grp:alt_shift_toggle" &

The lines above also allow you to toggle the language using 
shift + alt on your keyboard as well as the gxkb icon in the 
system tray if installed.

Remember, you can also add the country code entries directly to the
configuration file in this folder. This may be easier for most.

Here is a link that should provide you with the country codes:
